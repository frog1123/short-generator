What happened to the bully in your class?
She did an insane amount of growing up during college, including having to uproot her whole life to care for her family after her mom died suddenly. She reached out to me and others I know personally and directly addressed the bullying. We went out to lunch (she bought) and she was incredibly honest. Apologizing and acknowledging what she did and why it was wrong. Sheâ€™s now running a successful animal rescue organization with her long-term boyfriend and I wish her nothing but happiness.
